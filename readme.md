## Problem Statement

---
The world of eSports have spearheaded into the mainstream with multiple tech companies such as AMD and Intel jumping into the scene with sponsors and promotions to expand its presense throughout the digital culture. With so many players trying to participate, one must first earn their title by claiming victory. Whether a player is attempting to attract viewers for their brand or a broadcast is narrating a match, we cannot deny that decisions made by players can be analyzed on a macro and micro level to predict the outcome of a match. Here, we want to take those statistics into account and attempt to build a model as well as discover which factors are the most important in determining an outcome of a match by examining team objective completes and individual player statistics.




#### Description of the Game
Below is a map of "Summoner's Rift", the standard arena that players interact with each other. The game is a 5 vs. 5 match with the primary objective of destroying your opponent's base (Nexus). The game is comprised with 3 lanes (Top, Middle, and Bottom) with a wildcard role of being the "Jungler" that roams randomly into their opponents territory to scout or ambush said opponents.
